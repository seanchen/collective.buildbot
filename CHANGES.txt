0.4.2 (unreleased)
==================

  - Add trove category for Buildout recipes.
    [kdeldycke]

  - Add option to format mail specific for zope-test mailing list.
    [do3cc]


0.4.1 (2010-04-13)
==================

  - Add hg-branch-type option and support branch for Mercurial.
    [thefunny42]


0.4 (2010-02-19)
================

  - Set extended CSS as the default style. This was imported from brand new
    buildbot v0.7.12.
    [kdeldycke]

  - Projects are now sorted by ids.
    [thefunny42]

  - Slaves can use different python interpreter than the buildout
    does. You can define your interpretor with the ``executable``
    option.
    [thefunny42]

  - Values like ``*/4`` or ``8,12,16`` are now supported as valid cron
    specifiers.
    [thefunny42]


0.3.7 (2010-01-24)
==================

  - add num_events and num_events_max parameters. Thanks to Baiju M.
    [gawel]

  - buildbot requires the max_builds slave parameter to be an integer.
    [kdeldycke]


0.3.6 (2009-12-22)
==================

  - Better fix for similar project names that occur in different buildout
    parts.  For svn projects, this fixes that _trunk is appended unnecessarily
    and it allows the automatic projectname_branchname names to work again.

  - Setting "usepty" in the slave.tac to buildbot's new default of 0.  See
    http://buildbot.net/trac/ticket/158 and especially
    http://buildbot.net/trac/ticket/255 .  This fixes problems with simple
    shell commands like "cp" and "rm" failing for no apparent good reason.
    And the stdio output seems to react much quicker now: nice.
    [reinout]

  - Allow configuration updates to work again.
    [hannosch]

  - Add possibility to use the default scheduler that triggers a build after
    every change using a grace period waiting for more changes.
    [witsch]

  - When using svn and you test multiple branches of the same project, you now
    get project_branch-a, project_branch-b instead of project_2, project_3.
    Named after the branch/tag name.
    [reinout]

  - SVNScheduler changed the incoming change object in addChange to match
    to its internal structure. But the change is reused in the next project
    where it won't match any longer because of the change.
    [do3cc]

  - Offering two more mail features of buildbot for configuration in
    collective.buildbot mail-mode and mail-lookup. See updated
    collective.buildbot documentation [do3cc]

  - Fixed an issue with similar project names that appeared in different
    buildout parts [do3cc]

  - Fixed an issue with multiple repositories in a poller recipe
    [do3cc]


0.3.5 (2009-07-17)
====================

  - buildbot 0.7.11 compatibility

  - various small fixes


0.3.4 (2009-05-21)
====================

  - Remove useless imports in docs.
    [gawel]

  - Possible to configure ``PBListener``
    [stxnext]

  - Added support for CVS repositories in project recipe. Location of code in
    CVS is described by `cvsroot` and `cvsmodule`. This two parameters are
    taken by spliting on `!` sign on repository location.
    [stxnext]

  - IRC bot can join password protected channels.
    [stxnext]

  - Refactor of all doctests that demonstrate recipes that subclass BaseRecipe
    and rely upon it's write_config method. The implementation relies upon the
    ConfigParser module which utilizes a dictionary data structure for storage
    of sections and options. This can never be assumed to be ordered across
    Python versions and we really shouldn't care upon order in our
    implementation. Tests now verify existence within intended section and
    correct value, rather than placement.
    [andrewb]

  - Completing work from r67547 (e.g. Fixed occurrences of
    `email-notification-recipients` to the plural form).  When initializing
    collective.buildbot.project.Project we want to actually look for the plural
    version.  Additionally, we want our comment regarding notifications in
    master.cfg_tmpl to suggest the correct value to be set.
    [andrewb]

  - Make timeout configurable, globally and independently for build
    and test steps.
    [sidnei]

  - Strip always_use_latest option to avoid issues with whitespace.
    [sidnei]

  - Make Source Checkout retry up to 3 times, 10 seconds
    apart. Somehow later versions of buildbot seem to fail much more
    often when removing the checkout directory, and hopefully this
    will work around that.
    [sidnei]

  - Make Source Checkout mode configurable through ``vcs-mode``.
    [sidnei]

  - Make ``build`` steps set ``haltOnFailure=True``. No point in doing
    any testing if the build steps failed.
    [sidnei]

  - Fixed compatibility problem with buildbot 0.7.9
    [dokai]

  - Fixed problem with the test suite initialization which resulted in all
    the doctests not being run. Also fixed test regressions that had surfaced
    undetected because of the problem.
    [dokai]

0.3.3 (2008-09-26)
==================

  - Apply patch from Chris Shenton to override default umask
    [gawel]

  - Improve default template configuration
    [gawel]

  - Add clean css to template
    [gawel]

0.3.2 (2008-09-14)
==================

  - Add paster template to quickly generate a basic configuration
    [gawel]

  - Fixed occurrences of `email-notification-recipients` to the singular form
    as used in most places.
    [hannosch]

  - Added a mechanism to have username/password for Subversion authentication
    Which consists of a buildbot patch and a link to .httpauth on buildout
    side
    [tarek]

  - Add dependency between projects. The build of one project can
    trigger the build of one other. [thefunny]

  - Improve the virtual env creation for Windows (mingw) and Cygwin.
    Installation of eggs works with mingw, and we should get a python
    ../../bin/python for Cygwin as well (symlink to the python used to
    run buildout). [thefunny]

0.3.1 (2008-05-31)
==================

  - Fixed poller documentation and examples [mustapha]

  - Fixed failed tests when your executable is called something other
    than python, e.g python2.4 [mustapha]

0.3.0 (2008-05-28)
==================

  - Use a custom scheduler to get poller working again [gawel]

  - Add splitter option to the poller recipe [gawel]

  - Added support for running PyFlakes on projects [dokai]

  - Refactored project name extraction logic [dokai]

    - Added Git support

    - Added support for defining multiple projects that result in
      duplicate project names (e.g. projects referring to different
      branches in a Subversion repository.)

  - Try to retrieve project name from svn urls [gawel]

  - Use a random minute in cron-scheduler when we have more than one
    repository [gawel]

  - Deactive virtualenv under cygwin, this doesn't work [thefunny]

  - 'environment' can be used to specify environment variable on
    slaves [thefunny]

  - 'eggs' can be used to install extra eggs in slaves [thefunny]

  - Refactored the functionality of the 'projects' recipe into the
    'project' recipe and removed the 'projects' entry point. [dokai]

  - Refactored the functionality of the 'pollers' recipe into the
    'poller' recipe and removed the 'pollers' entry point. [dokai]

  - Poller config files are now named after the section name, allowing
    multiple poller sections to be defined. [dokai]

0.2.1 (2008-05-21)
==================

  - Fixed a critical typo in the slave name configuration in
    fullexample.txt [dokai]

0.2.0 (2008-05-21)
==================

  - Added irc options so you can attach an irc bot to the master buildbot
    [mustapha]

  - Allow public_html customization [gawel]

  - Added custom about page to link to collective.buildout [gawel]

  - Added support for Git repositories [dokai]

  - Refactored the repository URL configuration. For Subversion, you
    should use only the ``repository`` option to specify a full URL to
    the desired branch (trunk, tag or branch) that will be built. For
    Git in addition to setting the ``repository`` option you can use
    the ``branch`` option to specify a specific branch to build. By
    default the ``master`` branch will be used for Git
    repositories. [dokai]

  - Cleaned up a lot of redundant imports. [dokai]

  - Updated the documentation and examples. [dokai]

  - Deprecated the collective.buildbot:projects recipe [dokai]

  - Fixed problem with missing twistd.log files on first run [dokai]

  - Fixed bug that prevented the master from starting if there weren't
    any SVN pollers configured. [dokai]

  - Added new options ``periodic-scheduler`` and ``cron-scheduler`` to
    set up passive schedulers for projects. [dokai]


0.1.1 (2008-05-02)
==================

  - bugs fixes [gawel]

0.1.0 (xxxx-xx-xx)
==================

 - Created recipe with ZopeSkel [Gael Pasgrimaud].
